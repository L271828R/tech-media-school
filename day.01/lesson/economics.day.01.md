# Introduction:

The resources that we value—time, money, labor, tools, land, and raw materials—exist in limited supply. There are simply never enough resources to meet all our needs and desires. This condition is known as scarcity. This interest in scarcity and how we react to has led to a field of study called Economics.

## So let us try to define Economics in the broadest form possible.

 It’s the study of scarcity.
 The study of how people use resources and respond to incentives.
 The study of decision-making.

Let us analyze this further. We are here because I as your teacher have an excess of information. And you the students have a scarcity of information. In some way you or your parents decided that the incentive to learn was a good use of their scarce resource which is the money paid for this program. In essence both the school and you interacted with ‘The Market’.

Or a friend invites you to a party. The incentive is having fun.
The organizer of the party enjoys your company and you enjoy the party as well. But nothing is free and the scarce resource you gave up was your time.

## Let us define what is a market:

The concept of a market is any structure that allows buyers and sellers to exchange any type of goods, services and information. The exchange of goods or services, with or without money, is a transaction.

## The 4 questions many Economists must ask:

What should be produced?
How many should be produced?
What methods should be used?
How should we distribute those goods?

**Student time:**

With the person next to you, mention a random country and ask how you would answer the 4 questions?

IE: 

Student 1: Morocco
Student 2: I would produce textiles. I would produce depending on how much cotton I have. I would use industrial methods if possible. Distribute them via ship.

Student 2: Colombia
Student 1: I would produce coffee. I would produce depending on how much fertilizer I have.
I can only use manual labor, since coffee cannot be picked by robots. Distribute them via ship.

If you were the country of Japan, how would you answer these 4 questions?
If you were the country of France, how would you answer these 4 questions?
Do you think France and Japan can be good trading partners?
